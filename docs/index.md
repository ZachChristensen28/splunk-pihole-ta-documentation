The Pi-hole Add-on allows Splunk data administrators to map the Pi-Hole速 DNS server events to the CIM enabling the data to be used with other Splunk Apps, such as the [Pihole App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4506).

## Assumptions

This documentation assumes the following:

1. You have a working Pi-hole server.
